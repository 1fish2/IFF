The "EA IFF-85" Repository
==========================

*   IFF docs with Commodore revisions/

    The original IFF docs with some revisions from Commodore Business Machines, as published by Commodore.

    Thankfully, Commodore converted the docs from MacWrite to Word format -- the *.doc files in this directory. I converted those to current MS Word format *.docx and from there to *.pdf and *.rtf files.

*   IFF source code/

    A version of the Amiga C code for reading and writing IFF files.

*   64-bit IFF.md

    Proposals for 64-bit (and larger) IFF data sizes. Not adopted.

*   IFF retrospective.md

    Notes on the history of IFF.
