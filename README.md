The "EA IFF-85" Repository
==========================

*   **IFF docs with Commodore revisions/**

    The original IFF docs with some revisions from Commodore Business Machines, as published by Commodore.

    Thankfully, Commodore converted the docs from MacWrite to Word format -- the *.doc files in this directory. I converted those to current MS Word format *.docx and from there to *.pdf and *.rtf files.

    * [EA IFF 85.pdf](http://1fish2.github.io/IFF/IFF%20docs%20with%20Commodore%20revisions/EA%20IFF%2085.pdf) defines the IFF standard and explains the philosophy of making programs write their data in an extensible interchange format rather than dumping internal state in a fixed format.
    * [IFF Quick Intro.pdf](http://1fish2.github.io/IFF/IFF%20docs%20with%20Commodore%20revisions/IFF%20Quick Intro.pdf) is a quick introduction.
    * [ILBM.pdf](http://1fish2.github.io/IFF/IFF%20docs%20with%20Commodore%20revisions/ILBM.pdf) defines the raster image format (interleaved bitplanes) that's used heavily on the Commodore Amiga.
    * [8SVX.pdf](http://1fish2.github.io/IFF/IFF%20docs%20with%20Commodore%20revisions/8SVX.pdf) defines an 8-bit sound format.
    * [SMUS.pdf](http://1fish2.github.io/IFF/IFF%20docs%20with%20Commodore%20revisions/SMUS.pdf) defines a simple musical score format.
