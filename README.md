The "EA IFF-85" Repository
==========================

*   **IFF docs**

    The original Electronic Arts IFF docs with some revisions from Commodore Business Machines.

    Thankfully, Commodore converted the docs from MacWrite to Word format -- the \*.doc files in this repository. I converted those to .docx (MS Word format), .pdf, and .rtf files.

    * [EA IFF 85.pdf](http://1fish2.github.io/IFF/IFF%20docs%20with%20Commodore%20revisions/EA%20IFF%2085.pdf): **"EA IFF 85" Standard for Interchange Format Files** defines the IFF standard and explains the strategy of saving data in an extensible interchange format rather than dumping a program's internal state in a fixed format.
    * [IFF Quick Intro.pdf](http://1fish2.github.io/IFF/IFF%20docs%20with%20Commodore%20revisions/IFF%20Quick%20Intro.pdf): **A Quick Introduction to IFF** is a quick introduction for programmers in the 1980's.
    * [ILBM.pdf](http://1fish2.github.io/IFF/IFF%20docs%20with%20Commodore%20revisions/ILBM.pdf): **"ILBM" IFF Interleaved Bitmap** defines the raster image format (interleaved bitplanes) that's used heavily on the Commodore Amiga.
    * [8SVX.pdf](http://1fish2.github.io/IFF/IFF%20docs%20with%20Commodore%20revisions/8SVX.pdf): **"8SVX" IFF 8-Bit Sampled Voice** defines an 8-bit sampled sound format.
    * [SMUS.pdf](http://1fish2.github.io/IFF/IFF%20docs%20with%20Commodore%20revisions/SMUS.pdf): **"SMUS" IFF Simple Musical Score** defines a simple musical score format.
