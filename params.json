I converted those to current MS Word format *.docx and from there to *.pdf and *.rtf files.\r\n\r\n    [I'm figuring out how to make GitHub serve the docs for viewing in the browser rather than automatically downloading like this link [EA IFF 85.pdf](https://github.com/1fish2/IFF/blob/master/IFF%20docs%20with%20Commodore%20revisions/EA%20IFF%2085.pdf?raw=true) does.]\r\n\r\n*   **IFF source code/**\r\n\r\n    A version of the Amiga C code for reading and writing IFF files.\r\n\r\n*   **64-bit IFF.md**\r\n\r\n    Proposals for 64-bit (and larger) IFF data sizes.
