{"name":"IFF","tagline":"The \"EA IFF-85\" Repository","body":"The \"EA IFF-85\" [Repository](https://github.com/1fish2/IFF)\r\n==========================\r\n\r\n*   **IFF docs with Commodore revisions/**\r\n\r\n    The original IFF docs with some revisions from Commodore Business Machines, as published by Commodore.\r\n\r\n    Thankfully, Commodore converted the docs from MacWrite to Word format -- the *.doc files in this directory. I converted those to current MS Word format *.docx and from there to *.pdf and *.rtf files.\r\n\r\n    [EA IFF 85.pdf](http://1fish2.github.io/IFF/IFF%20docs%20with%20Commodore%20revisions/EA%20IFF%2085.pdf) defines the IFF standard and explains the philosophy of making programs write their data in an extensible interchange format rather than dumping internal state in a fixed format.\r\n\r\n    [IFF Quick Intro.pdf](http://1fish2.github.io/IFF/IFF%20docs%20with%20Commodore%20revisions/IFF%20Quick Intro.pdf) is a quick introduction.\r\n\r\n    [ILBM.pdf](http://1fish2.github.io/IFF/IFF%20docs%20with%20Commodore%20revisions/ILBM.pdf) defines the raster image format (interleaved bitplanes) that's used heavily on the Commodore Amiga.\r\n\r\n    [8SVX.pdf](http://1fish2.github.io/IFF/IFF%20docs%20with%20Commodore%20revisions/8SVX.pdf) defines an 8-bit sound format.\r\n\r\n    [SMUS.pdf](http://1fish2.github.io/IFF/IFF%20docs%20with%20Commodore%20revisions/SMUS.pdf) defines a simple musical score format.\r\n\r\n*   **[IFF source code/](https://github.com/1fish2/IFF/tree/master/IFF%20source%20code)**\r\n\r\n    A version of the Amiga C code for reading and writing IFF files.\r\n\r\n*   **[64-bit IFF.md](https://github.com/1fish2/IFF/blob/master/64-bit%20IFF.md)**\r\n\r\n    Proposals for 64-bit (and larger) IFF data sizes. Not adopted.\r\n\r\n*   **[IFF retrospective.md](https://github.com/1fish2/IFF/blob/master/IFF%20retrospective.md)**\r\n\r\n    Notes on the history of IFF.\r\n\r\n-- Jerry Morrison","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
