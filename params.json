I converted those to current MS Word format *.docx and from there to *.pdf and *.rtf files.\r\n\r\n    To view the docs:\r\n\r\n    * [EA IFF 85.pdf](IFF docs with Commodore revisions/EA IFF 85.pdf) defines the IFF standard and the philosophy of having programs write their data in an extensible interchange format\r\n    * [IFF Quick Intro.pdf](IFF docs with Commodore revisions/IFF Quick Intro.pdf) is a quick introduction\r\n    * [ILBM.pdf](IFF docs with Commodore revisions/ILBM.pdf) defines the raster image format (interleaved bitmaps) that's used heavily on the Commodore Amiga\r\n    * [8SVX.pdf](IFF docs with Commodore revisions/8SVX.pdf) defines an 8-bit sound format\r\n    * [SMUS.pdf](IFF docs with Commodore revisions/SMUS.pdf) defines a simple musical score format\r\n\r\n*   **IFF source code/**\r\n\r\n    A version of the Amiga C code for reading and writing IFF files.\r\n\r\n*   **64-bit IFF.md**\r\n\r\n    Proposals for 64-bit (and larger) IFF data sizes. Not adopted.\r\n\r\n*   **IFF retrospective.md**\r\n\r\n    Notes on the history of IFF.\r\n\r\n-- @1fish2","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
